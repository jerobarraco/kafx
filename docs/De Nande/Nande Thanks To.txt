1st of all my mother.
No, i'm not that edipic, but basically, 
(besides giving my birth) she pays for everything i use :D
So i owe she everything.

Zheo, who is always helping me with kafx and with whom i hold all the discussions about
technical details.. Also because he knows a lot of encoding, effects, and everything
referrent to fansubbing; so he always knows all the techniques for effects, and all 
the variants on the different programs.. Thanks to him i didn't had to evaluate that much
how to make the program, also i've met overlua from him and that made me choose cairo.

JFS for making overlua (and developing aegi?),
that was the inspiration for the startpoint of the avs version of
kafx, also for choosing cairo, for making it opensource and for NOT choosing python :D
Also is good to know that both softwares aim for different targets.

Johnny, who i ask everything about new ideas, and to whom this program is dedicated to.

Zeth, who demostrated intrest in kafx and created the installer,
wich gave a big kickstart for new users

Zheo, Sakura, Zeth, AbelKM who help me on continue 

And all the comunity at myopera, for the support, for watching, commenting, criticizing,
ideas, basically everything :D
