Cairo&#x27;s compositing operators
</div>





<div id="content">
<p>Normally, you will be using cairo to draw objects on top of each other.
But cairo can do differently, if you need it! In fact, you can use all
the Porter/Duff compositing operators.</p>

<p>Fourteen different operators are currently available in cairo. This page
is a try to describe them. It may contain errors and is possibly
incomplete. Please help to improve it!</p>

<h1>Example images</h1>

<p>It is probably best to describe the effect of compositing operators by
showing example images, so that's what is done below. The images show
the result of drawing an object (a translucent blue rectangle) onto a surface which
already contains another image (a translucent red rectangle).</p>

<p>The operator names try to describe what the operators mean. Two words
need to be mentioned: the <em>source</em> and the <em>destination</em> (or <em>dest</em>). In
this context, these provide the two objects which contribute to the
graphical output of the drawing operation. The destination is the name
of the surface before the drawing operation, the source is the name of
what is added while drawing.</p>

<h2>The Destination</h2>

<p>To create the example images, the red rectangle is first drawn to the
(empty) destination surface with the default operator:</p>

<pre><code>cairo_rectangle (cr, 0, 0, 120, 90);
cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, 0.7, 0, 0, 0.8);
cairo_fill (cr);
</code></pre>

<p>The surface is now a transparent plane with a partially transparent
rectangle in it. This represents the destination to which the next
drawing operation will be performed. Both the red and the fully
transparent part of the surface are now natural parts of the
destination.</p>

<h2>Setting the compositing operator</h2>

<p>The current operator is now set using
<a href="http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-context.html#cairo-set-operator"><code>cairo_set_operator()</code></a>.</p>

<h2>The Source</h2>

<p>The <a href="../tutorial/">tutorial</a> describes how drawing works in cairo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Cairo internally draws with one fundamental drawing operation: the
source and mask are freely placed somewhere over the destination. Then
the layers are all pressed together and the paint from the source is
transferred to the destination wherever the mask allows it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is no mention of a mask in the names of the compositing
operators. They refer to a source and a destination only. This allows
for two different interpretations with regard to what should be regarded
as the source for the compositing operation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since the mask determines where the paint from the source is
transferred, it also determines the area in which the compositing
operation is performed. This interpretation can be called
<strong>bounded</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The area where the compositing operation is performed is not bounded
by the mask. Instead, any parts where the source layer is not
transferred are considered to be fully transparent. We call this
interpretation of the source <strong>unbounded</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For some of the operators, both interpretations lead to the same result,
for others they do not. In cairo, the actual interpretation depends on
the operator.  The unbounded operators modify destination outside of the
bounds of the mask.  However, their effect can still be limited by way
of clipping.  See the section on <a href="#clipmask">clipping and masking</a>
for those details.</p>

<p>The blue rectangle is drawn with the new operator in effect:</p>

<pre><code>cairo_rectangle (cr, 40, 30, 120, 90);
cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, 0, 0, 0.9, 0.4);
cairo_fill (cr);
</code></pre>

<p>The results can be seen in the images below. Note that both rectangles
are drawn with transparency. When studying the images, you may be able
to guess how they would look for opaque objects, too. For reference, the
<a href="ops.c">code</a> to create the images is also available.</p>

<h1>Operators</h1>

<p>For the mathematical description, it is convenient to use the following
conventions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The index A (assigned to color components and transparency factor)
refers to the source, while the index B refers to the destination.
The index R refers to the result of the compositing operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Each pixel in both the source and the destination is fully described
by a tuple (r, g, b, a). We will use "x" as a shorthand for any
color component, since they are always treated the same. "a"
describes the alpha value (opacity) and is treated differently.</p></li>
<li><p>The product of xA and aA is described by xaA. xaB and xaR have
analogous meaning.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The color computations equations contain a division by aR, which cannot
be done where aR is zero. But in this case the color doesn't matter
anyway (full transparency) and can also be set to zero. (Internally, the
colors may be handled differently, so this might or might not be
necessary.)</p>

<h2 id="clear">CAIRO_OPERATOR_CLEAR</h2>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./clear.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>Where the second object is drawn, the first is completely removed.
Anywhere else it is left intact. The second object itself is not drawn.</p>

<p>The effect of the <code>CLEAR</code> operator depends on the interpretation of the
source. In cairo, this operator is <strong>bounded</strong>.</p>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./source.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>The second object is drawn as if nothing else were below. Only outside
of the blue rectangle the red one is left intact.</p>

<p>The effect of the <code>SOURCE</code> operator depends on the interpretation of the
source. In cairo, this operator is <strong>bounded</strong>.</p>

<p>The image shows what you would expect if you held two semi-transparent
slides on top of each other. This operator is cairo's default operator. </p>

<p>The output of the <code>OVER</code> operator is the same for both bounded and
unbounded source.</p>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./in.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>The first object is removed completely, the second is only drawn where
the first was.</p>

<p>Note that the transparency of the first object is taken into account.
That is, the small blue rectangle is slightly lighter than it would have
been, had the first object been opaque.</p>

<p>The effect of the <code>IN</code> operator depends on the interpretation of the
source. In cairo, this operator is <strong>unbounded</strong>.</p>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./out.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>The blue rectangle is drawn only where the red one wasn't. Since the red
one was partially transparent, you can see a blue shadow in the
overlapping area. Otherwise, the red object is completely removed.</p>

<p>The effect of the <code>OUT</code> operator depends on the interpretation of the
source. In cairo, this operator is <strong>unbounded</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="atop">CAIRO_OPERATOR_ATOP</h2>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./atop.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>This leaves the first object mostly intact, but mixes both objects in
the overlapping area. The second object object is not drawn except
there.</p>

<p>If you look closely, you will notice that the resulting color in the
overlapping area is different from what the <code>OVER</code> operator produces.
Any two operators produce different output in the overlapping area!</p>

<p>The output of the <code>ATOP</code> operator is the same for both bounded and
unbounded source.</p>

<h2 id="dest">CAIRO_OPERATOR_DEST</h2>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./dest.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>Leaves the first object untouched, the second is discarded completely.</p>

<p>The output of the <code>DEST</code> operator is the same for both bounded and
unbounded source.</p>

<h2 id="dest_over">CAIRO_OPERATOR_DEST_OVER</h2>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./dest_over.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>The result is similar to the <code>OVER</code> operator. Except that the "order" of
the objects is reversed, so the second is drawn below the first.</p>

<p>The output of the <code>DEST_OVER</code> operator is the same for both bounded and
unbounded source.</p>

<h2 id="dest_in">CAIRO_OPERATOR_DEST_IN</h2>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./dest_in.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>The blue rectangle is used to determine which part of the red one is
left intact. Anything outside the overlapping area is removed.</p>

<p>This works like the <code>IN</code> operator, but again with the second object
"below" the first.</p>

<p>Similar to the two interpretations of the source, it is possible to
imagine the same distinction with regard to the destination. In cairo,
the <code>DEST_IN</code> operator is <strong>unbounded</strong>.</p>

<div class="tutright"><img src="./dest_out.png" alt="" width="160" height="120" /></div>

<p>The second object is used to reduce the visibility of the first in the
overlapping area. Its transparency/opacity is taken into account. The
second object is not drawn itself.</p>

<p>The output of the <code>DEST_OUT</code> operator is the same for both bounded and
unbounded interpretations.</p>

<h1 id="clipmask">Clipping and masking</h1>

<p>This section augments the documentation of cairo's compositing model
by describing how clipping and masking are taken into account when
rendering.  In this context the <i>clip</i> and <i>mask</i> are treated as
cairo surfaces with <a href="http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-surface.html#cairo-content-t&quot;&quot;">alpha
content</a> that both default to full opaqueness when not explicitly given.
The basic approach to clipping in cairo is to first perform the
operation without clipping and then interpolating by the clip
pointwise between the unclipped result and the destination.  In the
descriptions below this is achieved using a ternary operator
<i>A</i> LERP<i><sub>T</sub></i> <i>B</i> that is defined here as:</p>

<p><center>
    <i>A</i> LERP<i><sub>T</sub></i> <i>B</i> := (<i>A</i> IN
    <i>T</i>) ADD (<i>B</i> OUT <i>T</i>)
</center></p>

<p>The approach to masking is to combine it using operator IN with either the <i>clip</i>, for
the bounded operators, or with the source for the unbounded ones.</p>

<p>There are three distinct rendering equations used within cairo to
implement clipping and masking, which can be described using the
(unclipped, unmasked) operators IN, OUT and ADD operators as primitives.</p>

<table align="center" border="1">
 <tr>
  <th>Kind</th>
  <th>Equation</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>XRender</td>
  <td align="right"> ((<i>src</i> IN <i>mask</i>) <i>OP</i> <i>dst</i>) LERP<sub><i>clip</i></sub> <i>dst</i></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Bounded</td>
  <td align="right"> (<i>src OP dst</i>) LERP<sub>(<i>clip</i> IN <i>mask</i>)</sub> <i>dst</i> </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Simple</td>
  <td align="right"> (<i>src</i> IN (<i>clip</i> IN <i>mask</i>)) <i>OP</i> <i>dst</i> </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>The XRender-kind definition most closely matches the letter of the
XRender specification as it reduces to XRender's equation when
<i>clip</i> is binary valued -- the only kind of clip talked about in
the spec.  The Simple-kind definition is the fastest to execute and
was conceived of as an optimisation of the XRender-kind
definition to take advantage of the fact that for many operators the two coincide.
The Bounded definition is a variation of the XRender-kind
definition where the mask is considered to be a part of the clip.  It
is used for the SOURCE and CLEAR operators only, and is used 
to make those operators be explicitly bounded by <i>mask</i>.
The following table gives the rendering equation used by each of cairo's
operators.  The entries marked with Any are operators for
which all three variants coincide.</p>
