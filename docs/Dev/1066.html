<p>I planned to conclude my exploration of 4Suite this time, but
  events since last month's article led me to discuss some fundamental
  techniques for Python-XML processing first.  First, I consider ways
  of producing XML output in Python, which might make you wonder
  what's wrong with good old <code>print</code>?  Indeed programmers
  often use simple print statements in order to generate XML.  But
  this approach is not without hazards, and it's good to be aware of
  them. It's even better to learn about tools that can help you avoid
  the hazards.</p>



  <h3>Minding the Law</h3>

  <p>The main problem with simple <code>print</code> is that it knows
  nothing about the syntactic restrictions in XML standards.  As long
  as you can trust all sources of text to be rendered as proper XML,
  you can constrain the output as appropriate; but it's very easy to
  run into subtle problems which even experts may miss.
  </p>

  <p>XML has been praised partly because, by setting down some
  important syntactic rules, it eases the path to interoperability
  across languages, tools, and platforms.  When these rules are
  ignored, XML loses much of its advantage.  Unfortunately, developers
  often produce XML carelessly, resulting in broken XML.  The RSS
  community is a good example.  RSS uses XML (and, in some variants,
  RDF) in order to standardize syntax, but many RSS feeds produce
  malformed XML.  Since some of these feeds are popular, the result
  has been a spate of RSS processors that are so forgiving, they will
  even accept broken XML.  Which is a pity.</p>

  <p>Eric van der Vlist -- as reported in his article for XML.com, "<a
  href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/06/26/vocabularies.html">Cataloging
  XML Vocabularies</a>" -- found that a significant number of Web
  documents with XML namespaces are not well-formed, including XHTML
  documents.  Even a tech-savvy outfit like Wired has had <a
  href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1802">problems</a> developing
  systems that reliably put out well-formed XML.  </p>

  <p>My point is that there's no reason why Python developers
  shouldn't be good citizens in producing well-formed XML output.  We
  have a variety of tools and a language which allows us to express
  our intent very clearly.  All we need is to take a suitable amount
  of care.  Consider the snippet in Listing 1.  It defines a function,
  <code>write_xml_log_entry</code>, for writing log file entries as
  little XML documents, using the <code>print</code> keyword and
  formatted strings.</p>

  <h4>Listing 1: Simple script to write XML log entries</h4>
  <pre><code>import time

LOG_LEVELS = ['DEBUG', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']

def write_xml_log_entry(level, msg):
    #Note: in a real application, I would use ISO 8601 for the date
    #asctime used here for simplicity
    now = time.asctime(time.localtime())
    params = {'level': LOG_LEVELS[level], 'date': now, 'msg': msg}
    print '&lt;entry level="%(level)s" date="%(date)s"&gt; \
\n%(msg)s\n&lt;/entry&gt;' % params
    return

write_xml_log_entry(0, "'Twas brillig and the slithy toves")
#sleep one second
#Space out the log messages just for fun
time.sleep(1)
write_xml_log_entry(1, "And as in uffish thought he stood,")
time.sleep(1)
write_xml_log_entry(0, "The vorpal blade went snicker snack")  </code></pre>

  <p>Listing 1 also includes a few lines to exercise the
  <code>write_xml_log_entry</code> function.  All in all, this script
  is straightforward enough.  The output looks like
  </p>

  <pre><code>$ python listing1.py 
&lt;entry level="DEBUG" date="Mon Oct 21 22:11:01 2002"&gt;
'Twas brillig and the slithy toves
&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;entry level="WARNING" date="Mon Oct 21 22:11:03 2002"&gt;
And as in uffish thought he stood,
&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;entry level="DEBUG" date="Mon Oct 21 22:11:07 2002"&gt;
The vorpal blade went snicker snack
&lt;/entry&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>But what if someone uses this function thus:</p>

  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_log_entry(2, "In any triangle, each interior angle &lt; 90 degrees")
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 05:41:31 2002"&gt;
In any triangle, each interior angle &lt; 90 degrees
&lt;/entry&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>Now the result isn't well-formed XML.  The character "&lt;"
  should, of course, have been escaped to "&amp;lt;".  And there's a
  policy issue to consider.  Are messages passed into the logging
  function merely strings of unescaped character data, or are they
  structured, markup-containing XML fragments?  The latter policy
  might be prudent if you want to allow people to mark up log entries
  by, say, italicizing a portion of the message:  </p>

  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_log_entry(2, "Came no church of cut stone signed: &lt;i&gt;Adamo me fecit.&lt;/i&gt;")
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 05:41:31 2002"&gt;
Came no church of cut stone signed: &lt;i&gt;Adamo me fecit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>I've reused the <code>write_xml_log_entry</code> function because
  <code>msg</code>-as-markup is the policy implied by the function as
  currently written.  There are further policy issues to consider.  In
  particular, to what XML vocabularies do you constrain output, if
  any?  Allowing the user to pass markup often entails that they have
  the responsibility for passing in well-formed markup.  The other
  approach, where the <code>msg</code> parameter is merely character
  data, usually entails that the <code>write_xml_log_entry</code>
  function will perform the escaping required to produce well-formed
  XML in the end.  For this purpose I can use the <code>escape</code>
  utility function in the <code>xml.sax.saxutils</code> module.
  Listing 2 defines a function,
  <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code>, which performs such
  escaping. </p>

  <h4>Listing 2: Simple script to write XML log entries, with the
  policy that messages passed in are considered character data</h4>
  <pre><code>import time
from xml.sax import saxutils

LOG_LEVELS = ['DEBUG', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']

def write_xml_cdata_log_entry(level, msg):
    #Note: in a real application, I would use ISO 8601 for the date
    #asctime used here for simplicity
    now = time.asctime(time.localtime())
    params = {'level': LOG_LEVELS[level], 'date': now, 
              'msg': saxutils.escape(msg)}
    print '&lt;entry level="%(level)s" date="%(date)s"&gt; \
\n%(msg)s\n&lt;/entry&gt;' % params
    return  </code></pre>

  <p>This function is now a bit safer to use for arbitrary text.  </p>

  <pre><code>$ python -i listing2.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, "In any triangle, each interior angle &lt; 90\260")
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 06:33:51 2002"&gt;
In any triangle, each interior angle &amp;lt; 90°
&lt;/entry&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>

  <p>And it enforces the policy of no embedded markup in messages.  </p>

  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, "Came no church of cut stone signed: &lt;i&gt;Adamo me fecit.&lt;/i&gt;")
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 06:41:31 2002"&gt;
Came no church of cut stone signed: &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Adamo me fecit.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>Notice that <code>escape</code> also escapes "&gt;" characters,
  which is not required by XML in character data but is often
  preferred by users for congruity.  </p>


  <h3>Minding Your Character</h3>

  <p>Python's regular strings are byte arrays. Characters are
  represented as one or more bytes each, depending on the encoding, but
  the string does not indicate which encoding was used. If it surprises
  you to hear that characters might be represented using more than one
  byte, consider Asian writing systems, where there are far more
  characters available than could be squeezed into the 255 a byte can
  represent.  For this reason, some character encodings, such as
  UTF-8, use more than one byte to encode a single character.  Other
  encodings, such as UTF-16 and UTF-32, effectively organize the byte
  sequence into groups of two or four bytes, each of which is the
  basic unit of the character encoding.</p>

  <p>Because most single-byte encodings, such as as ISO-8859-1, are
  identical in the ASCII byte range (<code>0x00</code> to
  <code>0x7F</code>), it's generally safe to use Python's strings if
  they contain only ASCII characters and you're using a single-byte
  encoding (other than the old IBM mainframe standard, EBCDIC, which
  is different from ASCII throughout its range). But in any case,
  especially if you put non-ASCII characters in one of these regular
  strings, both the sender and receiver of these bytes need to be in
  agreement about what encoding was used.</p>

  <p>The problems associated with encoded strings are easy to
  demonstrate. Consider one of the earlier examples, with a slight
  change -- the word "degrees" has been replaced with the byte
  B0 (octal 260), which is the degree symbol in the
  popular ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 character encodings:  </p>

  <pre><code>$ python -i listing2.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, "In any triangle, each interior angle &lt; 90\260")
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 06:33:51 2002"&gt;
In any triangle, each interior angle &amp;lt; 90°
&lt;/entry&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>The <code>\260</code> is an octal escape for characters in Python.  It
   represents a byte of octal value 260 (B0 hex, 176 decimal).</p>

</p>






  <p>As for the output produced by
  <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code>, the characters seem properly
  escaped, but there may still be a problem.  If this output is to
  stand alone as an XML document, it's not be well-formed.  The
  problem is that there is no XML declaration, so the character
  encoding is assumed by XML processors to be UTF-8.  But the degree
  symbol at the end of the string makes it illegal UTF-8; an XML
  parser would signal an error.  This is one of the most common
  symptoms of bad XML I have seen: documents encoded in ISO-8859-1 or
  some other encoding which are not marked as such in an XML
  declaration.  </p>

  <p>Just adding an XML declaration is not necessarily a solution.  If
  I have the function add</p>

  <pre><code>"&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;"</code></pre>

  <p>then the previous function invocation produces problem-free
  XML. But nothing prevents <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code> from being
  passed a message in an encoding other than ISO-8859-1.  Almost any
  sequence of bytes can be interpreted ISO-8859-1, so no error would
  be detected.  But this is merely masking a deeper, more insidious
  problem: the text would be completely misinterpreted.  To illustrate
  this specious fix, Listing 3 forces an ISO-8859-1 XML declaration.
  </p>

  <h4>Listing 3: a variation on write_xml_cdata_log_entry which
  always puts out an ISO-8859-1 XML declaration</h4>

  <pre><code>import time
from xml.sax import saxutils

LOG_LEVELS = ['DEBUG', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']

def write_xml_cdata_log_entry(level, msg):
    #Note: in a real application, I would use ISO 8601 for the date
    #asctime used here for simplicity
    now = time.asctime(time.localtime())
    params = {'level': LOG_LEVELS[level], 'date': now, 
              'msg': saxutils.escape(msg)}
    print '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;'
    print '&lt;entry level="%(level)s" date="%(date)s"&gt; \
\n%(msg)s\n&lt;/entry&gt;' % params
    return  </code></pre>

  <p>To understand the nastiness that lurks within this seeming fix,
  take the case where a user passes in a string with a UTF-8 sequence
  with a Japanese message, which translates to "Welcome" in English.
  </p>

  <pre><code>$ python -i listing2.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, "\343\202\210\343\201\206\343\201\223\343\201\235")
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 15:54:36 2002"&gt;
ã‚ˆãfl†ãfl“ãfl?
&lt;/entry&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>An XML parser would accept this with no complaint.  The problem
  is that any processing tools looking at this XML would read the
  individual sequences of the UTF-8 encoding as separate ISO-8859-1
  characters. Which means they would see twelve characters, rather
  than the four which our imaginary Japanese user thought she had
  specified.  Even worse, unless this text is displayed in a system
  localized for Japanese, it will come out as a mess of accented "a"s
  and other strange characters, rather than the dignified Japanese
  welcome intended by the user, illustrated in Figure 1.
  </p>

  <h4>Figure 1: A Japanese Welcome</h4>
  
    <img src="/2002/11/13/graphics/figure1.png"/>
  

  <p>Character encoding issues are a very tricky business, and you
  should always defer to the tools that your language and operating
  environment provide for such magic, if for no other reason than to
  pass the buck when something goes wrong.  In Python's case, this
  means using the Unicode facilities available in Python 1.6 and 2.x
  (although I still highly recommend Python 2.2 or more recent for XML
  processing).  In fact, I use and strongly encourage the following
  rule for XML processing in Python: <b>In all public APIs for XML
  processing, character data should be passed in strictly as Python
  Unicode objects.</b></p>

  <p>In fact, I encourage that all use of strings in programs that
  process XML should be in the form of Unicode objects, but following
  the above rule alone will prevent a lot of problems.  Listing 4
  updates <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code> to follow this rule.
  </p>

  <h4>Listing 4: a variation on write_xml_cdata_log_entry which
  strictly accepts Python Unicode objects for message text.</h4>

  <pre><code>import time, types
from xml.sax import saxutils

LOG_LEVELS = ['DEBUG', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']

def write_xml_cdata_log_entry(level, msg):
    if not isinstance(msg, types.UnicodeType):
        raise TypeError("XML character data must be passed in as a unicode object")
    now = time.asctime(time.localtime())
    encoded_msg = saxutils.escape(msg).encode('UTF-8')
    params = {'level': LOG_LEVELS[level], 'date': now, 'msg': encoded_msg}
    print '&lt;entry level="%(level)s" date="%(date)s"&gt; \
\n%(msg)s\n&lt;/entry&gt;' % params
    return  </code></pre>

  <p>Pay particular attention to the line </p>

  <pre><code>encoded_msg = saxutils.escape(msg).encode('UTF-8')</code></pre>

  <p>Not only does this line escape characters that are illegal in XML
  character data, but it also encodes the Unicode object as a UTF-8
  byte string.  This is needed because most output, including printing
  to consoles and writing to files on most operating systems, requires
  conversion to byte streams.  This means using an 8-bit encoding for
  strings that were originally in Unicode (because of my suggested
  rule).  The <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code> function always
  uses UTF-8 for this output encoding, which means that it doesn't
  have to put out an XML declaration that specifies an encoding.  I
  should point out that in general it's considered good practice to
  always use an XML declaration which specifies an encoding, but I
  wrote the function this way as an illustration.
  </p>

  <p>This version of the <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code>
  function is safe as far as character encodings are concerned.  It
  doesn't care whether the character data came from an ISO-8859-1
  string, a UTF-8 string, or any other form of string, as long as it
  is passed in as a Unicode object.
  </p>

  <pre><code>$ python -i listing4.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, "In any triangle, each interior angle &lt; 90\260")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "listing4.py", line 8, in write_xml_cdata_log_entry
    raise TypeError("XML character data must be passed in as a unicode object")
TypeError: XML character data must be passed in as a unicode object  </code></pre>

  <p>This exception is as expected.  We passed in a plain byte string
  rather than a Unicode object and the function is enforcing policy.
  </p>

  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, u"In any triangle, each interior angle &lt; 90\u00B0")
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 17:58:08 2002"&gt;
In any triangle, each interior angle &amp;lt; 90Â°
&lt;/entry&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>The log message unicode object includes a character,
  <code>\u00B0</code> in the Python notation for explicitly representing a
  Unicode <b>code point</b>.  A code point is a number that uniquely
  identifies one of the many characters Unicode defines.  Here, of course,
  the code point represents the degree symbol.  In this case, it would
  also be correct to use the regular octal escape character <code>\260</code>,
  but I recommend using the "\u" form of escape in Python Unicode objects.
  Be wary of using the
  position of the character you want in your local encoding as the
  Unicode code point.  For example, on Macs predating OS X, the 176th
  character is the infinity symbol (<code>"\u221E"/</code>), rather than the
  degree symbol.</p>

  <p>The function outputs the single degree character as a two-byte UTF-8
  sequence.  Since my console thinks it is displaying ISO-8859-1, the
  bytes appear to be separate characters, but an XML processor would
  properly read the sequence as a single character.</p>

  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; #The following two lines are equivalent
&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = unicode("\343\202\210\343\201\206\343\201\223\343\201\235", "UTF-8")
&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = "\343\202\210\343\201\206\343\201\223\343\201\235".decode("UTF-8")
&gt;&gt;&gt; write_xml_cdata_log_entry(2, msg)
&lt;entry level="ERROR" date="Tue Oct 22 18:10:57 2002"&gt;
ã‚ˆãfl†ãfl“ãfl?
&lt;/entry&gt;  </code></pre>

  <p>First, I create a Unicode object from the UTF-8-encoded string,
  and then pass it to the function, which outputs it as UTF-8.  This
  is no longer a problem because the parser will recognize the
  encoding as UTF-8, rather than confusing it as ISO-8859-1, as
  before.
  </p>




  <h3>Not Quite There Yet</h3>

  <p>But this function is still not failsafe.  A remaining problem
  is that XML only allows a limited set of characters to be present in
  markup.  For example, the form feed character is illegal.  There is
  nothing in our function to prevent a user from inserting a form feed
  character, which would result in malformed XML.  There are other
  subtleties to consider. Users of 4Suite have handy functions that
  take care of most of the concerns surrounding the output of XML
  character data.  The one of most interest in this discussion is
  <code>Ft.Xml.Lib.String.TranslateCdata</code>.  Listing 5 is a
  version of <code>write_xml_cdata_log_entry</code> that uses
  <code>TranslateCdata</code> to render character data as well-formed
  XML.
  </p>

  <h4>Listing 5: a variation on write_xml_cdata_log_entry which uses
  Ft.Xml.Lib.String.TranslateCdata from 4Suite for safer XML

    now = time.asctime(time.localtime())
    encoded_msg = TranslateCdata(msg)
    params = {'level': LOG_LEVELS[level], 'date': now, 'msg': encoded_msg}
    print '&lt;entry level="%(level)s" date="%(date)s"&gt; \
\n%(msg)s\n&lt;/entry&gt;'% params
    return  </code></pre>

  <p>The key bit is now <code>encoded_msg = TranslateCdata(msg)</code>.</p>

  <p>Which uses the 4Suite function.  This takes care of the escaping,
  the character encoding, trapping illegal XML characters, and more.
  4Suite also provides functions that prepare character data to be
  output inside an XML attribute or for HTML output.</p>

  <p>But just to put another twist on the matter, even now the 4Suite
  developers are refining these functions for better design, and the
  signatures may change in future releases.  Since in many cases you
  have a special task to fulfill, and don't want to bear all the
  burden of XML correctness, this reinforces the importance of relying
  on third-party tools.  </p>

  <p>So much for the notion that XML output is nothing more than an
  exercise for the Python <code>print</code> keyword.  I haven't even
  plumbed all the issues involved, and I'll return to further concerns
  in future articles.  The main point I want to get across is that
  generating XML is not as easy as it would at first seem, and that
  you should use established tools as much as possible.  I have
  pointed out utility functions in the standard Python library and in
  4Suite.  Another approach is to create a DOM tree and then serialize
  it.  Just remember to always generate XML with a great deal of care
  and to test all output thoroughly with reliable XML parsers.  The
  world could certainly do with more good XML citizens.

  <p>Thanks to <a href="http://skew.org/xml/">Mike Brown</a>,an expert
  on the intersection of XML and character set arcana.  He reviewed
  this article for technical correctness and suggested important
  clarifications.</p>

  <h3>Python-XML Happenings</h3>

  <p>Here is a brief on significant new happenings relevant to
  Python-XML development, including significant software releases.
  Not much to report this month.</p>

  <p>Walter D&ouml;rwald <a
  href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/xml-sig/2002-October/008676.html">announced</a>
  version 2.0 of <a href="">XIST</a>, an XML-based extensible HTML
  generator written in Python.  The announcement also led to sime
  discussion of the use of namespaces in XIST, leading to this <a
  href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/xml-sig/2002-October/008696.html">clarification</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Henry Thompson appears to have responded to my teasing about the
  lack of distutils in <a
  href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~ht/xsv-status.html">XSV</a> with a <a
  href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/xml-sig/2002-November/008752.html">new
  release</a>.</p>

  <h3>Resources</h3>
  <ul>
  
  <li>Mike Brown maintains <a href="http://skew.org/xml/">the skew.org
  XML &amp; XSLT resources</a>, which includes articles and tutorials
  featuring many important tips on character sets, XML, XSLT, HTTP and
  other related topics.  In particular, <a
  href="http://www.skew.org/xml/tutorial/">The skew.org XML
  Tutorial. A reintroduction to XML with an emphasis on character
  encoding</a> is probably the best background resource available for
  many of the issues raised in this article.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0100.html">PEP
  100</a>, by Marc-Andre Lemburg, formally describes the Python
  Unicode system, but beginners to the topic should start with <a
  href="http://www.egenix.com/files/python/Unicode-EPC2002-Talk.pdf">the
  PDF slides of Marc-Andre's tutorial</a> or with <a
  href="http://www.reportlab.com/i18n/python_unicode_tutorial.html">Andy
  Robinson's tutorial</a>.</li> </ul>
