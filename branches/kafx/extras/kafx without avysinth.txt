 ok, i never finished this part... is somehow experimental, but it works...
i've left 2 scripts wich uses ffmpeg for de/compressing videos..
that makes avisynth (and the dll) completely unnecesary.

what does this mean? too much, so much that i won't tell openly :D
let me say that you'll only need python (py)cairo and ffmpeg, so basically you can use it on linux (at a fair speed)
(install : python pycairo cairo and ffmpeg)

how do you use it?
well, i wont explain really much... so you will need programming knowledge..

there are 2 scripts, kafx_console.py and kafx_ogl.py, both of them are the same, 
the last one uses opengl to show the video on a window... ()though i'd rather use sdl or sfml but i have no time to test it)...

how to use?
if you're using windows, you'll need ffmpeg on the path... basically nobody knows how to do that, so probably is best is to copy 
ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as the cairo implementation (the kafx root folder (where the kafx_main file is)) (A).
also copy kafx_console.py (OR kafx_ogl) and myconfig.py to the kafx root folder (A) basically you'll have:
ffmpeg.exe
kafx_console.py
myconfig.py
kafx_main.py
libs/
etc...

myconfig has some basic configuration you will need to modify for each video.. 
kafx_console.py will mix all the stuff: decoding, load kafx, process, coding

excecuting "python kafx_console.py" will do the trick... (or python kafx_ogl.py)
